# Roberts-Space-Industries-Gift-Generator

Simple attempt at making a program to **Brute** F**orce** Gift codes for Roberts Space Industries AKA Star Citizen.

# Info

This started as a test to see if you could guess Gift codes for items on the RSI website, After using a few valid codes I wrote this simple program that uses the cookies from your login to attempt to **Brute** F**orce** random gift codes in a attempt to get some that are valid. 

The issue; The issue with this is that the gift code is a string of 13 characters that include A-Z & 0-9. If you do the math to see how many potential combinations that would be its a huge number... **2.3107896E+9 or 2,310,789,600** to be exact. Meaning if you could test 50 codes a second it would take at least 535 days to do every possible code, and that's if you had a method of knowing if the code you are testing hasn't been used already.

So in the end, it basically pointless to try. The code works but is far to **inefficient.**

**Posting the code so others may learn from how I did this if they want.**
